This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(caret)
library(lime)

df_raw <- iris

trainIndex <- createDataPartition(df_raw$Species, p = 0.7, list= FALSE, times = 1)

df <- df_raw[trainIndex,]
df_lab <- df_raw[- trainIndex,]

# Create Random Forest model on iris data
model <- train(Species ~ ., 
               data = df, 
               method = 'rf')

# Create an explainer object
explainer <- lime(df, model)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
# Explain new observation
explanation <- explain(df[c(1,30,100),1:4], explainer, n_labels = 1, n_features = 2)

# The output is provided in a consistent tabular format and includes the
# output from the model.
head(explanation)
```

```{r}
plot_features(explanation)
```
```{r}
maxes <- apply(predict(model, df, type = "prob"), 1, FUN = max)

doubts <- maxes < 0.9

explanation <- explain(df[doubts, 1:4], explainer, n_labels = 1, n_features = 3)
plot_features(explanation)

```
