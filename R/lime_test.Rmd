This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(caret)
library(lime)
library(vcd)

data(Arthritis)

df_raw <- Arthritis
df_raw$target <- df_raw$Improved != "None"

trainIndex <- createDataPartition(df_raw$target, p = 0.7, list= FALSE, times = 1)

dummies <- dummyVars(target ~ Treatment + Sex + Age,
                     data = df_raw)

df_prep <- as.data.frame(predict(dummies, df_raw))
df_prep$target <- as.factor(df_raw$target)

df <- df_prep[trainIndex,]
df_lab <- df_prep[- trainIndex,]

# Create Random Forest model on iris data
model <- train(target ~ ., 
               data = df, 
               metric = "logloss",
               method = 'rf')

# Create an explainer object
explainer <- lime(df, model)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
# Explain new observation
explanation <- explain(df[c(1,30,31,45),], explainer, n_labels = 1, n_features = 2)

# The output is provided in a consistent tabular format and includes the
# output from the model.
head(explanation)
```

```{r}
plot_features(explanation)
```
